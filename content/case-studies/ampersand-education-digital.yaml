executive_summary: >
  Spearheaded comprehensive digital transformation of India's premier education conglomerate operating
  pan-India school network, partnering with Deloitte to create connected ecosystem with real-time
  operational visibility. Implemented eLMS for digital learning, GPS tracking for student safety,
  parent communication platforms, and Group ERP integration - modernizing traditional education
  delivery for 21st century digital-native families.

challenge:
  situation: >
    Ampersand Group operated prestigious school network across India with multiple business verticals
    (K-12 schools, preschools, teacher training, curriculum development) but relied on manual processes,
    disconnected systems, and limited digital engagement with parents and students in increasingly
    digital education landscape.

  problems:
    - "Manual attendance, fee collection, and administrative processes across school network"
    - "No digital learning management system for remote/hybrid education during COVID-19"
    - "Limited parent engagement and communication beyond physical parent-teacher meetings"
    - "No real-time visibility for management into operations across geographically distributed schools"
    - "Student safety concerns with no tracking of school bus locations"
    - "Fragmented data across schools preventing group-level analytics and decision-making"

  stakes: >
    Post-pandemic, parents expected digital-first education experiences. Without transformation,
    Ampersand risked losing enrollments to digitally advanced competitors, operational inefficiencies
    from manual processes, and inability to scale network profitably. Safety incidents without GPS
    tracking posed reputational and liability risks.

solution:
  strategy: >
    Partnered with Deloitte for comprehensive digital transformation covering student lifecycle
    (admission to alumni), parent engagement, learning management, operations automation, and
    real-time management dashboards. Cloud-first, mobile-first architecture with phased rollout
    across school network.
