executive_summary: >
  Key team member of Project Garuda - Unilever's worldwide PeopleSoft HRMS implementation across
  120 countries serving 10,000+ managers globally. Designed Common Core Data Architecture enabling
  global consistency while accommodating local compliance. Established Excellence Center in New Jersey,
  USA, providing global support and continuous improvement for one of the world's largest HR technology
  transformations in FMCG industry.

challenge:
  situation: >
    Unilever, operating in 120+ countries with diverse HR systems and processes, needed unified global
    HRMS platform to enable talent mobility, standardize core processes, provide executive visibility,
    and reduce total cost of ownership for fragmented HR technology landscape.

  problems:
    - "120+ countries with disparate HR systems and incompatible data formats"
    - "No global visibility into talent pipeline, succession planning, or workforce analytics"
    - "Inability to track and deploy talent across geographies"
    - "Inconsistent HR processes hindering operational efficiency and compliance"
    - "High cost of maintaining multiple legacy HR systems"
    - "Local statutory requirements in 120 countries (payroll, labor laws, benefits)"

  stakes: >
    Without global HRMS standardization, Unilever risked talent management inefficiencies, compliance
    violations in multiple jurisdictions, inability to execute global growth strategy, and spiraling
    IT costs. Project represented multi-million dollar investment requiring flawless execution.

solution:
  strategy: >
    Implement PeopleSoft HRMS as global standard with Common Core Data Architecture allowing 80%
    standardization and 20% local configuration for statutory compliance. Phased country-by-country
    rollout with regional wave approach. Establish global Excellence Center for support, training,
    and continuous improvement.
