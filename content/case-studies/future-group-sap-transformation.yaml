challenge:
  situation: >
    Future Group was scaling rapidly as India's largest retailer but running on fragmented legacy
    systems unable to support multi-format retail strategy (hypermarkets, supermarkets, fashion,
    electronics, home improvement) and explosive growth trajectory.

  problems:
    - "Multiple disconnected systems across store formats"
    - "No real-time inventory visibility across 900+ stores and 35 warehouses"
    - "Manual processes limiting scalability and operational efficiency"
    - "Lack of data analytics for strategic decision-making"
    - "Inability to support emerging e-commerce channel"
    - "30,000+ suppliers requiring integrated procure-to-pay processes"

  stakes: >
    Without unified technology platform, Future Group risked operational chaos, inventory
    mismanagement, customer dissatisfaction, and inability to compete with emerging organized
    retail and e-commerce players in India.

solution:
  strategy: >
    Comprehensive enterprise transformation using SAP IS Retail as backbone, integrated with
    custom-built loyalty program, e-commerce platform, and advanced analytics. Phased rollout
