# Executive Summary
executive_summary: >
  Led the end-to-end establishment of THG Ingenuity India—transforming a blank canvas into a
  fully operational Global Capability Center (GCC) with 100+ engineers delivering across
  logistics, AI, and platform technology. Orchestrated every aspect from legal incorporation,
  regulatory compliance, infrastructure build-out, to cultural integration between UK and India,
  setting a new benchmark for global tech expansion.

# Challenge/Problem Statement
challenge:
  situation: >
    THG needed to expand its technology footprint to India, not just as an outsourcing destination
    but as a full-fledged Global Capability Center that would mirror THG's innovation culture,
    operational excellence, and collaborative DNA. The challenge was building an entire ecosystem
    from scratch with seamless UK-India integration.

  problems:
    - "No legal entity or operational presence in India"
    - "Complex regulatory landscape requiring FDI compliance, tax structuring, and multi-agency coordination"
    - "Need for world-class infrastructure matching UK headquarters standards"
    - "Transition of 60+ engineers from EOR model to direct payroll"
    - "Establishing governance, financial controls, and audit-ready operations"
    - "Building cultural bridge between Manchester HQ and Pune operations"

  stakes: >
    Without proper execution, THG risked compliance violations, infrastructure delays, talent
    attrition, operational inefficiencies, and failure to realize the strategic value of a
    high-performing GCC contributing to core engineering and innovation.

# Solution/Approach
solution:
  strategy: >
    Comprehensive end-to-end orchestration covering legal incorporation, regulatory compliance,
    infrastructure development, HR transition, governance establishment, and cultural integration.
    Multi-track parallel execution ensuring speed without compromising compliance or quality.
